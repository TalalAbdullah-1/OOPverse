# OOPverse (use this link and and enjoy https://talalabdullah-1.github.io/OOPverse/)

"Because reading 500 university slides is a violation of the Geneva Convention."

💀 Why does this exist?

Let's be real for a second. You have an OOP exam coming up. You don't know what a Virtual Destructor is. The textbook reads like a stereo instruction manual from 1985.

OOPverse is the solution. It’s a Cyberpunk-themed learning platform that forces C++ concepts into your brain using neon lights, sarcasm, and actual gameplay. It’s not just a study guide; it’s a survival mechanism.

🚀 Features

📚 16 Modules (That actually make sense)

We cover everything from Introduction to STL.

Real Talk: Theory explained like you're a human being, not a compiler.

Visuals: High-quality diagrams (no weird pixelated text overlays).

Pro Exam Tips: Cheat codes for your brain so you don't fail.

Choose Your Sensei:

🌶️ Desi Mode: Links to the legends (CodeWithHarry, Jenny).

🍔 Borgir Mode: Western style (Bro Code, Cherno).

👮 The OOP Officer (Gemini AI)

I built a chatbot. It’s smarter than us.

Smart Mode: Plug in your Gemini API key and it actually solves your problems.

Roast Mode: Don't have a key? It just mocks you for being broke.

🎮 The Arcade (Procrastination Station)

Five randomized games because writing code is hard:

Null Pointer RPG: Turn-based combat. Miss a question? You leak memory and die.

Heap Rush: Rapid-fire True/False. Panic inducing.

Memory Matrix: Match definitions. Good for the brain, bad for the ego.

Syntax Scramble: Drag-and-drop code lines. It’s like a puzzle, but frustrating.

Bug Hunter: Find the missing semicolon. (Spoiler: It’s always the semicolon).

📝 Exam Simulator

Generates random questions from a massive bank every time. No syntax highlighting. No help. Just you and a blank text box. Good luck.

🛠️ Tech Stack

React 18: Loaded via CDN because npm install takes 3 years and I have patience issues.

Tailwind CSS: Because writing raw CSS is for psychopaths.

Babel: To make the React magic happen in a single file.

Google Gemini API: The brain behind the bot.

💿 How to Run

This is a Single File Application. I respect your disk space too much to make you download a node_modules folder.

Download oop_verse.html.

Double-click it.

That's literally it.

If you can't open an HTML file, we need to have a serious talk about your IT major.

🔑 AI Setup (Optional)

To unleash the full power of the Officer:

Click the Chat Button (Bottom Right).

Hit the Settings Gear ⚙️.

Paste your Gemini API Key (It's free from Google).

The key saves to your browser's local storage. I don't want it.
